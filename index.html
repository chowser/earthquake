      The following is a geographic chart that allows a user to select how far
      back to display historical earthquake data for the state of Oklahoma.
      Once a start year has been selected, clicking the "Create Map" button
      will display circles that visualize earthquakes that have occurred since
      the selected start year.  The circle radius signifies the relative
      magnitude of the earthquake. A color scale is also used ranging from
      yellow to red, with yellow representing low magnitude and red representing
      high magnitude. Data was sourced from several locations.  The outline of
      Oklahoma and its counties is generated from GeoJSON data, which in turn
      was generated from a shapefile provided by US Census Bureau.  Injection
      well locations are displayed as green dots and were sourced from the
      Oklahoma Corporation Commission.  Historical earthquake data was sourced
      from the US Geological Survey.
